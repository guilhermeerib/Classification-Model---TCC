She's not funny, she's not entertaining, she comes across as a surly teenage girl who is just upset at the slightest thing and just doesn't want to be there. This is not a character you can build a movie around, like trying to make a teenage Groot movie! It wouldn't work, but he's okay as a side character.\n",

Now I can't really get a definitive answer. From what I see it's a combination of people not liking her attitude and her comments on feminism. So I Googled further to see what she said, she came across arrogant in them and a smidge out of touch but none of it explained the overwhelming hate I've seen aimed at her. Then I remembered that people talk about all the different types of bigotry but misogyny rarely comes up, I remembered that it's visibly increased over the past decade and appreciated why she's been targeted. News flash, the outspoken loud brash man hating femnists you likely thing of when you hear that word make up a very small percentage. Feminism is good, if you disagree I hope you simply don't know the meaning of the word.\n",

I fear that it's not unstoppable however, as the sub-par Captain Marvel has painfully illustrated.

And for the record, people are criticizing this movie because it was bad, not because they \"haaaate the wooomans!\" Dismissing legitimate criticisms using this tactic will not produce better films, which is the only thing most people want. The problem is that they built the movie around the idea of \"strong woman\" and promoted it as an identity film, so when the movie ends up being bad some people rush to defend it because they don't want the IDEA to fail. The movie itself is secondary - just a vehicle to slap their bumper stickers on, which is a real shame because this could have been a great addition to the MCU. I hope they learn something from this, but from what I've heard it appears that Marvel actually plans to escalate the identity politics in the next phase which would be an absolute disaster for them.
