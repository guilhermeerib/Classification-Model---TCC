      "The entire Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is a complete travesty. I read these books when I was very young (I'm 24 now) and after watching the movies and seeing the new covers for the books, my disappointment was heightened. One of the major purposes of any work of fiction is to exercise the imagination in the form of creating images of the things in the work, especially the characters. Now, when someone reads these books after watching the movies (even The Hobbitt) the reader will have a preset image of the characters that they've seen. The Lord of the Rings is one of history's greatest series of fictional books simply because of the imagination put forth in creating an entire world to base it on; that's now basically ruined because of the movies. A good comparison would be the Dune series, which I now feel uncomfortable reading simply because I saw the Sci-fi channels presentations of the book and Children of Dune. The only reason that the movie deserves a 4 is because of the quality of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3\n",
      "It is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium.These three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible. For example Peter Jackson knew that he could New Zealand Citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown New Zealand Countryside.Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost. This was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did. How the motion Picture Academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious.The cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques. This has been supported many Cinematographers in many blogs.The acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from Australians and New Zealanders due to Peter Jackson's view that they are better actors than Americans and the British. In fact Australians and New Zealanders have this strange dislike Americans despite consuming their films.The animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in \"dusk till dawn\" it makes you wonder if the CGI people had much imagination. The many gratuitously violent scenes, not described as such in the books, would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the Golum. In fact most of the CGI was carried out by Americans hired by Peter Jacksons multi-million dollar CGI suite.Which at the end of the day makes you wonder where Mr Peter Jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi-million dollar film effects studio in New Zealand.The whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with Peter Jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the project.It is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination.It was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement. I fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldn't go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in CGI. I am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like John Boorman who was originally going to make the film.I am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and Peter Jackson.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3\n",
      "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original \"Star Wars\" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first \"Star Wars\" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review \"Star Wars\" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to \"Star Wars\" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of \"Lord of the Rings\" or \"Star Trek\" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               3\n",
      "Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy is a monumental achievement, I won't argue with that. The sheer scope of the project and the fact that Jackson was able to wrangle it into three blockbuster and seamless films is cause for admiration.But it's a monumental project that left me cold, and if you're a movie goer who's made to feel like a pariah by the series' idolatrous fanboys for not thinking it's the greatest thing to ever befall our civilization, give me a shout, because it would give me comfort to know there are others out there.After nine hours of Elijah Wood's one expression of wide-eyed bewilderment; of Viggo Mortenson's uber-sombre line readings; of Orlando Bloom's silly hair; and of relentless gray and brown battle scenes, I'd had enough. I think it says something about your endeavor when the most interesting character in the film is the one who's computer animated.The person who really deserves the most credit for this trilogy is its editor(s), who had to take god knows how many hours of footage and shape it into something resembling a movie.Grade: B                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3\n",
      "The ambitious Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist Margo Channing (Bette Davis) and her friends Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) and her husband, the play-writer Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe); her boyfriend and director Bill Sampson (Gary Marrow); and the producer Max Fabian (Gregory Ratoff). Everybody, except the cynical critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders), believe that Eve is only a naive, humble and simple obsessed fan of Margo and they try to help her. However, Eve is indeed a cynical and manipulative snake that uses the lives of Margo and her friends to reach her objectives in the theater business.\"All About Eve\" is a magnificent timeless tale of ambition, manipulation and betrayal, and certainly one of the best classics ever. Everything perfectly works in this movie: the direction is very precise and tight; dialogs are very acid and intelligent; Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders and Celeste Holm have awesome performances in very powerful characters; the dramatic story is amazingly good, showing what an evil person can plot to reach fame and success. I believe this movie will always be among my ten favorite movies ever.

      "Well-made and mounted chronicle of the relationship between opera composers Mozart and Salieri, the latter a court-appointed Vienna composer who simply could not keep up with the effortless showmanship of his prime competition. Peter Shaffer adapted his own celebrated play and Milos Forman helmed the smooth direction (both won Oscars), but neither is very generous in showing us the creative process behind the music. There's far more love for the classical pieces on display than actual insight into how the music was created. F. Murray Abraham is deliciously dark as Salieri and won the Oscar for Best Actor; Tom Hulce as jolly Mozart is uneven, occasionally forced or strained; supporting cast, too, is variable. Winner of eight Oscars in all, including Best Picture. **1/2 from ****                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

Also, we see the movie, of course, may miss some of the plays but being a movie, we have replaced them with visions of Prague, where the movie was filmed.The only thing that can be a bit annoying to some people is the laughing style they gave Mozart (Tom Hulce) in this production.Be sure to watch the extra information where the different actors and the director talk about the trials and tribulations of getting a film crew into Prague in 1984 and having to deal with the secret police.Get a different view of the play in Midsomer Murders: The Death of a Hollow Man.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "The long (nearly 3 hours) biopic is good, even very good, but it'd be nothing if not for F. Murray Abraham's amazing performance, just extraordinary. He's worth your time, even if Tom Hulce turns out not to be your cup of tea. F. is so good that even those who don't dig classical music will get into the groove; he's that passionate. The movie's also artfully framed by Forman, with some exquisite cinematography and, of course, compelling music.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "I am sure that casting Tom Hulce as Mozart was a great risk, but unfortunately that was the main thing that kept me from enjoying this movie. It wasn't all Hulce's fault, since there was a decision to have him insert an exceedingly irritating cackle at pretty much random points. Whoever dreamed that up must have really liked the idea, since there is one final cackle that closes the movie after all of the end credits have run. Hulce's attempts to act as an orchestra conductor were on a par with what you would expect from some untutored middle school student, what with gesticulations that mainly just kept the beat. Mozart was a musical genius who challenged the hidebound opinions of the times as to what was deemed acceptable. In that he is little different from early rock-and-roll stars. As presented he was a young, brash, free spirit (so at least the audience was spared the ponderous, agonized artist trope) with few endearing qualities. Granted, there seems to have been a large disparity between Mozart the person and his incredible music, but I cannot believe that he was quite the fool as what is seen here; the personality set forth was not credible to me. If only we had a time machine.There are some good things, like a couple of good performances. F. Murry Abraham is a standout in his subtle portrayal of Antonio Salieri. In this movie Salieri is a tragic figure. He was a popular and respected musician in the court of Emperor Joseph II. Beethoven and Schubert were among his students and I think Salieri gets somewhat of a bum rap in this movie. Solieri's torture was to recognize the difference between his talents and the pure genius of Mozart causing a serious conflict between jealousy and awe. I have seen this scenario played out in the workplace and it would have worked out for the best if the inferior party had just accepted that he was out-gunned; the results were unfortunate, as with Salieri. I thought that Jeffery Jones was particularly effective as Emperor Joseph II. He could walk the fine line between haughtiness and genuine feeling with aplomb.The staging of the opera segments is brilliant. In fact a movie with just extended opera segments, so presented, would be a treasure. As appropriate, Mozart's music plays a central role. But they never let it play for any decent length of time. Particularly irritating was the interruption of the staging of the final scene of \"The marriage of Figaro\" with a voice-over from Salieri. Couldn't they at least spare a few minutes to let the audience appreciate one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written? If that piece does not convince anyone of Mozart's genius, then there is no hope that that appreciation will ever be sparked. At least they had enough sense not to interrupt the Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem played over his burial. The brief scenes from \"The Magic Flute\" left me wanting more--the translation into English for those scenes was clever.The production is lavish and a delight to watch. The film deserved its Oscar for costume design--the costumes must have been a major expense. The filming is first rate with sets and architecture that created (at least for me) a feel for what 18th century Vienna must have been like. Some scenes were filmed in an opera house where Mozart himself conducted.    1\n",
      "Kill Bill Volume 2 (directed by Quentin Tarantino) is a great, great movie. I don't know why Uma Thurman didn't get nominated for Best Actress because she gives a fantastic, emotional performance. There really is nothing wrong with this movie. The soundtrack is great, the directing brilliant and the dialogue better than the first.In Vol. 2 we follow The Bride's story of revenge. For those who haven't seen the first: The Bride (Uma Thurman) was gunned down at her wedding by the DIVAS. She has killed O-Ren Ishii (AKA Cottonmouth) and Vernita Green (AKA Copperhead). She still needs to kill Budd \"Sidewinder\" (Michael Madsen), Elle \"California Mountain Snake\" (Daryl Hannah) and of course Bill \"Snake Charmer\" (David Carradine). In typical QT style we flash back and forth, revealing The Bride's past and how she came to be such a good fighter.This, as I said before, is flawless. Uma Thurman gives a wonderful performance. Daryl Hannah plays a villain very well. Michael Madsen and David Carradine also give great performances. The music in this is wonderful and suits the movie perfectly. Luckily Vol. 2 has some better dialogue that we can remember.The fight scenes in this are very well done and keep us watching. QT has done a great job summing this tale up.5/5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
